# Project Title  
Implementation of Cloud Security Architecture for Sensitive Data Protection

## a. Project Purpose or Justification  
Migrating critical services and data to cloud environments brings numerous benefits, but it also introduces vulnerabilities. The absence of a robust security architecture can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and damage to the company's reputation.  
This project is essential to ensure that the organization complies with security standards and protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data. By implementing technical controls and security policies in cloud environments, the company will be able to operate with confidence and efficiency, dramatically reducing the risk of cyber attacks.

## b. Measurable Project Objectives and Related Success Criteria  

- **Objective:** Implement multi-factor authentication for all privileged users.  
  **Success criteria:** 100% of users with administrative permissions will have MFA enabled by the project completion date.

- **Objective:** Encrypt all sensitive data stored in the cloud.  
  **Success criteria:** Encryption enabled on 100% of buckets, volumes, and databases containing data classified as sensitive.

- **Objective:** Reduce the risks identified in the initial audit.  
  **Success criteria:** At least 80% of the risks listed in the initial assessment report will be mitigated by the end of the project.

## c. High-Level Requirements  
- The solution must use cloud-native security tools.  
- All access to the cloud must be logged and auditable.  
- There must be a formal incident response plan for cybersecurity-related events.

## d. Assumptions and Constraints  

**Assumptions:**  
- The technical team, including the Cloud Security Engineer, Junior Analyst, and Project Manager, will be available to participate in training and validation sessions.  
- The AWS services used support all required security features.

**Constraints:**  
- The project must be completed by December 2025.  
- The total available budget is limited to 15,500€.

## e. High-Level Risks  
- Lack of technical experience of the internal team with cloud security tools.  
- Resistance to change on the part of users.  
- Possible delays in the approval of permissions and configurations by IT management.

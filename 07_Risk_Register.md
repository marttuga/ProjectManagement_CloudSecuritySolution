# Project Risks

1. **Delay in Cloud Environment Delivery**  
- **Description:** The cloud provider may delay the setup of the environment, postponing the start of testing.  
- **Mitigation:** Confirm deadlines with the provider and have an alternative provider on standby if possible.  
- **Contingency:** Use a local environment temporarily for development/testing until the cloud environment is available.  
- **Impact:** High  
- **Likelihood:** Medium  
- **Priority:** High  

2. **Issues with System Integration (VMs and Containers)**  
- **Description:** Technical difficulties may arise in integrating virtual machines and containers, delaying development.  
- **Mitigation:** Conduct detailed integration planning and use pre-configured test environments.  
- **Contingency:** Revert to manual integration temporarily or reduce functionality to meet deadlines.  
- **Impact:** Medium  
- **Likelihood:** Medium  
- **Priority:** Medium  

3. **Lack of Specialist Personnel**

- **Impact:** Medium  
- **Likelihood:** Medium  
- **Priority:** Medium  

7. **Changes in Project Scope**

### Budget Discussion

- **Labour:**  
  Estimated using average freelance hourly rates in Portugal:  
  - Cloud Security Engineer: approx. 25€/hour for ~80 hours per month, reflecting specialised skills required for design, implementation, and security reviews.  
  - Junior Analyst: approx. 12.5€/hour for ~80 hours per month, covering data gathering, monitoring support, and documentation assistance.  
  - Project Manager: approx. 18.75€/hour for ~80 hours per month, responsible for planning, coordination, risk management, and stakeholder communication.  
  October and November involve more intensive tasks like auditing and remediation, which explains the increase in hours and costs.

- **Software/Services:**  
  Cloud infrastructure used for testing and development, primarily AWS services. The monthly AWS cost (100€) accounts for virtual machines, storage, and network resources.  
  Tools such as vulnerability scanners (OpenVAS, Snyk) incur a modest licensing or subscription fee (50€ per month), necessary to maintain security quality and automate vulnerability detection.

- **Training/Research:**  
  The team stays updated with the latest cloud security practices and relevant certifications. This includes time allocated to AWS documentation, specialised online training, and reviewing security best practices to ensure compliance and to strengthen team knowledge.

- **Materials:**  
  Covers costs associated with creating and maintaining project documentation (100€ per month) as well as licences or minor software tools needed throughout the project (100€ to 200€ per month).  
  This might include documentation templates, additional monitoring plugins, or any third-party software tools essential for smooth project delivery.

- **Overhead:**  
  Reflects indirect costs necessary to support a remote working environment, such as internet service, electricity, and basic office supplies. These costs are estimated conservatively at 100€ per month, supporting the infrastructure required for uninterrupted work.

- **Travel:**  
  No travel costs are budgeted as the entire project is planned to be executed remotely, eliminating expenses related to commuting, accommodation, or business travel.
